What is FLASH?
==============================
FLASH code is a modular, parallel multiphysics simulation code for modeling
terrestiral and astrophysical plasmas.  Features include:


    Grid: Uniform Grid, AMR

    Equation of State: Ideal gas, Multimaterial 

    Laser ray trace package

    Nuclear Burning 


Terminology
===============================
We have a perturbation-based multigroup solver in the Bright fuel cycle code [1]. 
This takes pre-computed libraries generated by a utility called Char [2]. 

These libraries are comprised of self-shielded, intragroup flux-weighted 
microscopic neutron cross sections for each nuclide for a suite of reactor states.

Where does FLASH fit in?
===============================
* Since source code modifications were needed, Serpent was the easier choice as
  homogenized material scattering kernel were already tallied. 

MCNP?
===============================
* Since source code modifications were needed, Serpent was the easier choice as
  homogenized material scattering kernel were already tallied. 

- In specific, Serpent returns the group transfer probabilities P [unitless]:

.. math:: \sum_h^G P_{g\to h} = \mathbf{\vec{1}}

.. math:: P_{g\to h} = \frac{\sigma_{s,g\to h}}{\sigma_{s,g}}


Anything
===============================
The scattering cross section of a material is the weighted sum of the cross sections
of its constituent species,

.. math:: \sigma_{s,g\to h} = \sum_i^I \frac{N_i}{N} \cdot \sigma_{s,g\to h,i}
