What is FLASH?
==============================
FLASH code is a modular, parallel multiphysics simulation code for modeling
terrestrial and astrophysical plasmas.  Features include:


    Grid: Uniform Grid, AMR

    Equation of State: Ideal gas, Multimaterial 

    Laser ray trace package

    Nuclear Burning 





Terminology
===============================
Free & open source software (FOSS) is lumped into a one category and
typically pitted against proprietary code.

    *Free and open are different axes, each on their own continuum.*





Openness
==================================
The "Open Source"-ness of software can be determined by answering questions 
such as the following:

The "Open Source"-ness of software can be determined by answering questions

Openness
==================================
The "Open Source"-ness of software can be determined by answering questions 
such as the following:

    - "How easy is it to obtain the source code?"

    * "What is the market penetration of the source in the community of interest?"





Free (as in Speech, not Beer)
=======================================
Freedom in software can be determined by the following:

Free (as in Speech, not Beer)
=======================================
Freedom in software can be determined by the following:

    * "How may the software be redistributed?"

    - "How may the software be modified?"

Freedom in software can be determined by the following:

    * "Who has to pay for the software (source or binary)
      and how much does it cost ($)?"

The FLASH License

- Only the FLASH Center may distribute the code; users
  must sign hard-copy License Agreement.

The FLASH License
===============================
Thus FLASH is both free-as-in-beer and open.

However, it is not free as in speech.

===============================
Thus FLASH is both free-as-in-beer and open.

However, it is not free as in speech.

This license agreement will persist due to the need to 
keep the code from becoming export controlled.

Open, But Not Free
=============================
The open-but-not-free situation is common to nuclear industry in a 
unique way.  

Open, But Not Free
=============================
The open-but-not-free situation is common to nuclear industry in a 
unique way.  

There are a great many packages on RSICC which are export controlled but provide
source code.

There are a great many packages on RSICC which are export controlled but provide

In other software based fields, free-but-not-open is the common alternative 
to FOSS or proprietary options.

- Creative expressions of data, however, are.

Jurisprudence
==============================
* Data bundled with export controlled software is effectively also 
  export controlled.

- Licenses are only valuable once their legality has been tested in 
  court.

MCNP is neither free as in beer nor as in speech (costs $$$, is

By analogy, MCNP is another code which is open but not free.  

MCNP is neither free as in beer nor as in speech (costs $$$, is 
export controlled).

Source code is distributed with 
huge market penetration. It is *effectively open source*
in the nuclear community.






Problems with Open But Not Free

Formal stratification between users and developers.

New features are added by developers and approved collaborators 
rather than by pull request.  This adds (justifiable) overhead.





Problems with Open But Not Free

People break the license.  Methods of recourse vary.

We are *very* concerned about export control.  We vigilantly screen out
code and data where there is any ambiguity.



Take Away Points

* Free and open are orthogonal, continuous, and individually important.

- Both sides of nuclear operate in the unusual open-but-not-free
